# Encryptify
This project provides a simple implementation of file encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data. This implementation allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt files with a secret key.

Features
AES-256 Encryption: Provides strong encryption using a 256-bit key.
File Encryption: Encrypt any file with a given key and initialization vector (IV).
File Decryption: Decrypt encrypted files back to their original form using the same key and IV.
